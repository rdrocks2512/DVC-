# Data Version Control or DVC is an open-source tool for data science and machine learning projects. 

## Key features:
### 1) Simple command line Git-like experience. Does not require installing and maintaining any databases. Does not depend on any proprietary online services.
### 2) Management and versioning of datasets and machine learning models. Data is saved in S3, Google cloud, Azure, Alibaba cloud, SSH server, HDFS, or even local HDD RAID.
### 3) Makes projects reproducible and shareable; helping to answer questions about how a model was built.
### 4) Helps manage experiments with Git tags/branches and metrics tracking.

## DVC aims to replace spreadsheet and document sharing tools (such as Excel or Google Docs) frequently used as both knowledge repositories and team ledgers.DVC also replaces both ad-hoc scripts to track, move, and deploy different model versions and ad-hoc data file suffixes and prefixes.
